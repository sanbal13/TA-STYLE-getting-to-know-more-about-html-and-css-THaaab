                <h3>Driver</h3>
                <p>
                    A driver allows the computer to communicate with the hardware. For example, a USB flash drive is a
                    physical
                    device that, when plugged into a computer, needs to “talk” with the computer to function. Drivers in
                    the
                    computer specifically for the USB, communicate and operate the USB.</p>


                <p>Lenovo recommendation: Only update drivers when the device is NOT performing as expected. It is
                    not required to have the latest hardware driver for every component in your computer.
                </p>

                <p>Where to get your drivers: support.lenovo.com
                </p>

                <p>Note: Select your product at the support Home Page > then click Drivers&Software. Select Component
                    and
                    the correct Operating System > then finally choose the available Drivers.

                <h3>BIOS and UEFI</h3>

                <p>BIOS and UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) are two firmware interfaces for computers
                    which work as an interpreter between the operating system and the computer firmware. Both of these
                    interfaces are used at the startup of the computer to initialize the hardware components and start
                    the
                    operating system which is stored on the hard drive.</p>

                <p>UEFI was introduced in Windows 8 to replace BIOS. UEFI firmware provides technical advantages over a
                    BIOS system.

                <h3>Firmware</h3>
                <p>
                    Firmware is the programming that delivers specific instructions to the hardware that tells your
                    phone how it operates. Sometimes features are added, or there are updates to improve the operation.
                    This
                    “software for hardware” is called a firmware update. When you load a firmware update to your
                    hardware,
                    the basic code gets overwritten by new operating instructions.
                </p>

                <p>Register your Lenovo device to make sure you receive critical product support and upgrades.
                </p>

                <p><em>Always confirm the device model number is compatible with the firmware update by clicking
                        Android Upgrade Matrix.</em>
